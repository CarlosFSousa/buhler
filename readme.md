Instructions:

1. This challenge contains a hidden message encoded in the comments and variable names.
2. Your task is to:"
   Copy the code below to your own .py file
   Understand the function's purpose
   Fix any bugs you find
   Implement the missing functionality in the decode_message function
   Use the function to extract and print the hidden message
3. Push your completed solution to your GitHub repository
   Hints:
   Pay attention to non-code elements
   The solution is not in the code itself, but in what the code reveals
   The decode_message function should return a string that makes sense
   Decode the hidden message from the processed data or other elements in this file.
   The implementation of this function is intentionally left incomplete. Developers should demonstrate their
   problem-solving abilities by:
4. Determining what the hidden message actually is
5. Implementing the correct decoding mechanism
